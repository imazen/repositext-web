We're proud to be a part of a growing movement of professionals in the tech and publishing industries who are using technology like Git to change the industry. The following is a list of organizations that are doing similar work; definitely worth checking out if you're interested in the context behind Repositext.

* [Efendi Books](https://efendibooks.com/about) was started by Jamie Rumbelow in February 2012 to help fellow web developers learn all the latest tech as well as write and publish their work. Their authors write their books in Markdown, check in content with Git and view the output instantly through their super-smart publishing pipeline.

* [Git-scribe](https://github.com/schacon/git-scribe) is a simple command line toolset to help you use Git, GitHub and Asciidoc to write e-books. This provides tools for setting up the structure, collaborating with co-authors, doing technical and copy-editing, handling translations, taking errata, as well as publishing online, pdf, mobi (Kindle) and epub (iBooks, Nook) versions.

* [Inundata](http://inundata.org/2012/12/06/pre-print-servers/) has written an excellent blog post about using servers to organize publication pre-print.

* [Easy Book](http://easybook-project.org/documentation/chapter-1.html) is an application that lets you easily publish books in various electronic formats. This resource is particularly useful for those interested in self-publication.

* [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/help/author_faq) is a GUI for writers that organizes books by chapter and formats the chapters in Markdown.

* [Bonfire](http://infews.github.io/bonfire/) is a resource for Ruby programmers that allows writing in a Markdown file and builds a set of HTML, CSS, image, and XML files that work as input to ebook "compilers" based on that file.

* [Flashbake](https://github.com/commandline/flashbake/wiki) started as a set of custom scripts for Cory Doctorow to help him use version control for understanding his writing process. The main focus of the scripts is to generate a rich but automated commit message for git. Secondarily, it automates managing a git project so a single, invariant call to flashbake takes care of the most common git workflow, adding and committing files. You can read about what Mr. Doctorow thinks of it [here](http://craphound.com/?p=2171)

* [Penflip](http://madebyloren.com/github-for-writers) is a work in progress meant to be a Github for writers.
