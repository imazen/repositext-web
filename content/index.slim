      ### Based on Git & Markdown

      **Git offers limitless workflow flexibility. Markdown offers a highly-refined content syntax. Together, they give us happy merges and clean version history.**

      Traditional CMSes enforce a linear workflow &mdash; something that's truly absurd in today's collaborative editing and multi-channel publishing world.

  ### Content entry-point doesn't matter

  Why should it matter what tools are used to create or edit content? We're creating precise **Markdown <-> Word**, **Markdown <-> InDesign**, and **Markdown <-> HTML** conversion tools (yes, *both* directions).

  This will enable easy transitions, support legacy content imports, and permit hybrid workflows (some contributors can use Word while others using Markdown directly). We anticipate building a drag-and-drop web interface to make hybrid situations easier.

  ### WYSIWYG is an anti-pattern

  As we publish to an ever-growing number of medias and devices, we discover the impossibility of making everything look the same everwhere. We also discover it's a terrible goal; each media needs adaption. Consistent, simple content formats allow us to do this easily with stylesheets.

  ### 100% Open-source
